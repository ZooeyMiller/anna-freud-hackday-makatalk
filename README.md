## What?

This is a product for clinicians working with young people with learning difficulties, it is to aid their communication with the young people, especially for when they are non-verbal. They currently conduct pre and post session questionairres using pen and paper, which is not the best medium for all of the patients.

## Why?

Currently the forms tend to be filled out by the patient's parents and thus don't accurately represent the views of the young
