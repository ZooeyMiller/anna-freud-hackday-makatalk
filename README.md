## What?
This is a product for clinicians working with young people with learning difficulties. The goal is to aid their communication with the young people, especially with those who are non-verbal. They currently conduct pre and post session questionnaires using pen and paper and relying on the ability to associate faces with emotions, which is not the best medium for all of the patients

## Why?
Currently the forms tend to be filled out by the patient's parents and thus don't accurately represent the views of the young person

## How?
An app that collects patient feedback on their week and their therapy session, which utilises more appropriate representations of grading emotions.



## User Journey

As a clinician I want to better understand the experiences of my service users and the feedback from our sessions so that I can get a better understanding of their needs and use that to inform our sessions and their treatment.

## User stories

As a clinician, I want to be able to collect the consent of my patient, or their representative, to that I can abide by my legal obligations as a clinician  

As a clinician I want to be able to add a new patient or select a patient that I have previously added

As a clinician I want to be able to modify the questionnaire based on the severity of the patient's learning difficulties. (mild/moderate/severe)

As a clinician I would like to track the progress of my patient in some form of graph (possible stretch goal)

As a clinician I would like the content of my questionnaire to be available in text, symbols, makaton videos and traffic light style colour representations, so that I can communicate effectively with my patients

As a clinician I would like to be able to use the app for the pre and post session questionnaire, so that I can understand how my patient's week and therapy session have been

As a clinician I would like to see the results of the questionnaire immediately so that I can use the information in my session

As a clinician I would like to be able to have a unique code for each patient so I don't have not use their name, so that I can abide by regulation around patient data protection

## Stretch goals
* get the parent's and teachers feedback on the content of the form for the patient too.

* implement rewards for patients who regularly fill out the forms

* multiple language support: eg. Portuguese, Somali, Tamil.


## Scope
main focus should be the actual questions and feedback screen (log in flow/session storage can be an afterthought).


## Notes
* Number of options really important (4 for mild?)
* sort out videos of people doing makaton
